# Java Programming MOOC

## Introduction

Welcome to the Java Programming MOOC repository from the University of Helsinki! This repository contains solutions to the programming exercises offered in the course. This Markdown file serves as a supplement to the code solutions, providing you with additional information, explanations, and guidelines.

## Understanding the Solutions

We recommend using these solutions as a reference and learning tool to better understand the concepts taught in the course. However, it's essential to make an effort to solve the exercises on your own before referring to the solutions.

For each exercise, you'll find a `Main.java` file that contains the solution code. Additionally, you might encounter other files or folders that are part of the solution implementation. Be sure to explore and understand these components.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:** To access the solutions, you can clone this repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/yousefdotpy/Mooc.fi-Java

2. **Navigate to the Solution:** Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the appropriate directory corresponding to the exercise and week you're interested in.

3. **Explore the Code:** Open the `Main.java` file to explore the solution code. Alongside the code, you can find comments that explain the logic and steps taken to solve the exercise.

4. **Experiment and Learn:** Don't just stop at reading the code. Experiment with it, make changes, and see how they affect the program's behavior. Learning is an active process!

## Asking for Help

If you encounter difficulties understanding a solution or have questions about the course concepts, feel free to ask for help. You can use the course forums, engage with your peers, or seek assistance from the course instructors.

Remember, the goal is not only to get the correct answers but to grasp the underlying principles of Java programming.

## Contributing and Feedback

If you find any issues with the solutions or want to contribute improvements, you can create pull requests. We appreciate your feedback and contributions to make this repository even more valuable for learners.

Happy coding and learning!
